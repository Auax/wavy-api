# Wavy-API 
#### The API behind the website [WAVY](https://auax.github.io/wavy/#/).
---
Created using Flask, a Python library.
This API uses `flask_socketio` to emit and receive incoming messages in rooms.

## Use the API in your website or application
If you wish to use this for your own project you must change the *CORS* allowed origins and include your domain. In my case I'm using this one: `https://auax.github.io`
